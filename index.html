      <strong>Salaar: Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire</strong> is a 2023 Indian
      Telugu-language epic neo-noir action thriller film directed by Prashanth
      Neel and produced by Vijay Kiragandur under Hombale Films. The film stars
      Prabhas in the titular role, alongside an ensemble cast of Prithviraj
      Sukumaran, Shruti Haasan, Jagapathi Babu, Bobby Simha, Sriya Reddy,
      Ramachandra Raju, John Vijay, Easwari Rao, Tinnu Anand, Devaraj, Brahmaji
      and Mime Gopi. In the fictional dystopian city-state of Khansaar, where
      monarchy still exists, the film follows the friendship between Deva
      (Prabhas), the exiled prince of Khansaar, and Varadha (Prithviraj
      Sukumaran), the current prince of Khansaar. When a coup d'Ã©tat is planned
      by his father's ministers and his relatives, Varadha enlists Deva's help
      to become Khansaar's undisputed ruler. The film's initial storyline was
      pitched from Neel's debut film Ugramm (2014) and is the maiden part of a
      two-part film.[4] It was officially announced in December 2020 under the
      title Salaar, however, in July 2023, its first instalment was titled as
      Salaar: Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire. Principal photography commenced in January
      2021, and occurred sporadically in several legs over nearly three years,
      before wrapping in late 2023. Filming locations included Telangana, Italy
      and Budapest. Production difficulties, ranging from the pandemic, reshoots
      and VFX delays, postponed Salaar's release date several times. The music
      is composed by Ravi Basrur, cinematography handled by Bhuvan Gowda and
      editing by Ujwal Kulkarni.

      before the release of the first film, with the title Pushpa 2 and later
      rebranded as Pushpa 2: The Rule with the release of the first film.[9][10]

      Devi Sri Prasad, cinematography by MirosÅ‚aw Kuba BroÅ¼ek, and editing by

      <strong>Adipurush</strong> is a 2023 Indian mythological action film
      inspired by the Hindu epic Ramayana.[8] The film is directed and
      co-written by Om Raut, and produced by T-Series and Retrophiles. Produced
      in Bollywood,[9] the film was shot simultaneously in Hindi and Telugu. The
      film features Prabhas, Saif Ali Khan, Kriti Sanon, Sunny Singh, and
      Devdutta Nage. The film was announced in August 2020, through an official
      motion poster. Principal photography, which took place primarily in
      Mumbai, commenced in February 2021 and ended in November 2021. The film's
      music is composed by Ajayâ€“Atul and Sachet-Parampara. Adipurush is budgeted
      at â‚¹500âˆ’700 crore (US$âˆ’83 million) and became one of the most expensive
      Indian films.[10][3][11] Adipurush was released on 16 June 2023. It was
      heavily panned by critics and audiences alike, who criticised the film's
      screenplay, dialogues and visuals.[12][13] It emerged as a box office
      bomb.[14] Thousands of years ago, the rakshasa king of Lanka, Lankesh,
      obtained a boon from Brahma, the god of creation, with which he cannot be
      slain by the gods or demons, during day or night, thus making him
      invincible. Elsewhere, many years afterwards in the kingdom of Ayodhya,
      King Dashratha of Kosala, exiles his son, Raghava for 14 years to fulfil
      his promise to his wife, Kaikeyi, Raghava's stepmother, that their son,
      Bharat, would ascend the throne. Raghava accepts the exile and leaves for
      the wilderness in the forests of Panchavati, near the river Godavari,
      alongside his wife, Janaki, and brother, Shesh.

      <strong>Animal</strong> is a 2023 Indian Hindi-language action drama
      film[1][5] co-written, directed and edited by Sandeep Reddy Vanga and
      produced by T-Series Films, Bhadrakali Pictures and Cine1 Studios. The
      film stars Ranbir Kapoor, Anil Kapoor, Bobby Deol, Rashmika Mandanna and
      Triptii Dimri. It explores the strained relationship between Ranvijay
      Singh and his father, Balbir Singh, an industrialist. After spending years
      abroad, Ranvijay returns home with plans for revenge against those who
      attempted to assassinate his father. The film was officially announced in
      January 2021. Principal photography began in April 2022 and wrapped by

      of 201 minutes, Animal is one of the longest Indian films ever made. It
      was initially set for an August 2023 release but was postponed due to
      post-production work.[6] Animal was theatrically released on 1 December
      2023, in standard and IMAX formats to mixed reviews, with praise for its
      cast, performances, direction, screenwriting, soundtrack, cinematography,
      action sequences and technical aspects, but faced severe criticism for its
      themes and graphic violence. However, the film did extremely well
      commercially, both domestically and internationally. It grossed between
      â‚¹917.82 crore (US$110 million) worldwide, making it the third
      highest-grossing Indian film of 2023, the fourth highest-grossing Hindi
      film, the ninth highest-grossing Indian film, the highest-grossing A-rated
      Indian film,[7] and the highest-grossing film of Ranbir Kapoor's
      career.[8][a]
